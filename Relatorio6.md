# Stage 6: Evaluation results and presentation of the final project

## **Problems pointed out by the heuristic evaluators**

<br>

### ***Lack of titles in subsections***
We completely agree with group 24, there was a lack of titles and this could leave the user trapped or confused. We added the title to the section mentioned to clarify the status of the system to the user, and also to keep things organized.

<br>

### ***Diferent designs in similar pages***

There was a page where the theme and overall placement of elements should be the same to the previous page. However, we weren’t able to keep them consistent due to lack of organization. Now this misconception has been fixed, and all pages follow the same pattern.

<br>

### ***No backtracking***

We agree with our colleagues with this. There should be more freedom to the user to go back if he wanted to, although the native android navigation buttons work.
Due to scarcity of time, we will not implement these “go back” buttons, since they require quite some coding and messing around with what we have.

<br>

### ***No information account***

There should be a way to know which account is logged on.
We figured out, since there was so little information about the user, and the data was quite disposable, that there was no need to have  user’s settings page. However this problem could be slightly fixed in the initial page where we greet the user, we could mention is name, or username.

<br>

### ***Inconsistent font weights***

This minor issue has been fixed and now all similar text has equal properties.

<br>

### ***Several spacing inconsistencies***

We had some different views with different spacings, but that has been easily fixed, and now, all items are equally spaced.

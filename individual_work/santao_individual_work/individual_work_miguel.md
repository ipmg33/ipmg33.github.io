## Bad Interface

This is the door to the ice maker from a siemens freezer, it is intended to open towards the user
since the mechanism that produces ice blocks the door form opening inwards. That is why there is a groove
bellow the door and a little curve at the bottom of it, so the user can pull it in order to get it open.


At first sight it might not be a bad interface, but since i have had this freezer for 8 years and everyone
that tries to grab some ice pushes the door instead of pulling it. I consider it a bad interface and this 
has happened to the point that now the door is constantly open inwards, which leads to people pushing it even more.

# Bad Interface

This is a bad interface because we can see that elements that should be grouped together are interwhined with others. This bad interface was the cause of a state wide false nuclear missile alarm, that created chaos in Hawaii. Also the options should be color coded and grouped.


# Good interface

This is a good interface because a user can easily see what he wants, whether he only wants to see his subscriber feed or the recommended videos. Everything is grouped together in different pages.

# Stage 1: Project Proposal

## Samevensa

Who has never taken a number and due to the long waiting queue went to do
something else and when returning back, lost their turn?
I suppose that has happened to a lot of us consumers, that go to the supermarket
to buy essential needs, three, four, five times a month or to us citizens, that have
to go update our citizen card once in a while.
<br>
Waiting queues are constantly present in our lives, and we need a system that
could control them more effectively, leaving time for people to do other things while
waiting and not be concerned if their turn has passed.

This project targets all individuals that will take a number who would like to do
something while waiting for their turn and all the workers behind the counter and
the store/business manager. Therefore we will target people ranging from
teenagers to elders.

Our main goal is to develop an interface that will allow the users to feel comfortable
while waiting in line, regardless of the service they're attending. Our solution is also
intended to allow the user to monitor their number in queue, giving them the chance
to do something useful while waiting.
<br>
The solution we came up with focuses on an interface where the user can choose
to take a number from a previously chosen service, and be able to verify how the
queue is moving, and how much time approximately it will take until their turn.
For the service provider, we thought of an interface that would allow them to check
on stats, such as how many people are in queue, time per client.
<br>
The back-office will be able to monitor all the stats from individual services, such
as the periods where there is more traffic, in some cases, the more efficient
employee, there will be the possibility to change which services the final user can
get a number from, and more.

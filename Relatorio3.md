## Briefing

Our system has the goal to manage the number taken in stores, by giving clients the information of what number is currently being seen and the estimated time to be seen, which will help people to do anything in the mean time. It also will provide statistics that the store manager can use to better help the venue, statistics such as the average waiting time, the busiest periods (being those hours or days), busiest departments.

## Scenarios

### Take a number
Take a number for the "Padaria" of "Loja Cascais".

### Check wait time
Check how much time you have waited for the "Charcutaria" in "Loja Santarém"
### Check the X statistic
